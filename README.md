## About The Project

This project aims to develop a neural network model capable of predicting the outcomes of football matches based on historical data. The model is trained on a dataset of football matches, which includes various features such as team performance metrics, match details, and results.

The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The provided Jupyter notebooks demonstrate the process of loading the football matches dataset, cleaning and transforming the data, handling missing values, and engineering new features to prepare the data for modeling.

2. **Model Development**: The notebooks also showcase the development of a neural network model using the Keras library in TensorFlow. The model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and training process are covered in detail.

3. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the trained model is evaluated on a separate test set, and the results are analyzed to assess the model's accuracy and reliability in predicting match outcomes.

4. **Deployment and Integration**: The final step would involve deploying the trained model and integrating it into a larger application or platform, allowing users to leverage the predictions for various purposes, such as betting, team analysis, or fan engagement.

### Built With

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- TensorFlow

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lorenzopalaia/football-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd football-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The project provides Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation steps. You can open these notebooks in a Jupyter environment and follow along with the code and explanations.

```python
# Example code snippet from the notebooks
import pandas as pd

# Load the preprocessed dataset
df = pd.read_csv('matches_final.csv')

# Perform additional analysis or model fine-tuning
# ...
```

For more detailed usage examples and instructions, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/lorenzopalaia/football-prediction).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement a web-based interface for the model predictions
- [ ] Explore additional feature engineering techniques
- [ ] Investigate the use of ensemble models for improved accuracy
- [ ] Expand the dataset to include more leagues and competitions
